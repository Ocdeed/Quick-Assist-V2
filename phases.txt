Of course. A well-defined roadmap is the final piece of our planning phase. It turns our database schema and API endpoints into an actionable, step-by-step development plan. This ensures we build the project logically, feature by feature, preventing chaos and making progress measurable.

Here is the updated, comprehensive development roadmap for QUICKASSIST. We will break it down into five distinct phases, moving from the foundational setup to advanced features and final polishing.

Updated Development Roadmap for QUICKASSIST

This roadmap is structured as a series of development phases, each with a clear goal, a set of specific tasks for both the backend and frontend, and a defined milestone.

Total Estimated Timeline: 14-16 weeks (typical for a final year project)

Phase 1: Foundation & Core Authentication (Weeks 1-3)

Goal: Establish the project's skeleton, set up the development environment, and implement the complete user authentication and profile management system.

Key Tasks:

Backend (Django):

Initialize Django project and create apps: users, services, payments, etc.

Configure PostgreSQL database connection.

Implement the User, Profile, and ProviderProfile models from the schema.

Set up Django REST Framework (DRF) and configure JWT for authentication.

Build the Authentication Endpoints (/api/v1/auth/):

register/

login/ (token generation)

logout/

Build the User Management Endpoints (/api/v1/users/me/) to view and update profiles.

Configure the built-in Django Admin to view and manage registered users.

Frontend (React):

Set up React project using create-react-app or Vite.

Structure the project folders (components, pages, services, hooks).

Set up axios for API calls and configure an interceptor to attach the JWT token to requests.

Build the core pages: Landing, Login, Registration, and a basic User Dashboard.

Implement state management (e.g., React Context API) to handle user authentication state globally.

Milestone at End of Phase 1:
A new user can successfully register as either a "Customer" or "Provider," log in, receive a secure token, view their profile page, update their information, and log out.

Phase 2: The Core Service Workflow (Weeks 4-7)

Goal: Implement the main business logic of the application: creating a service request and matching it with a provider.

Key Tasks:

Backend (Django):

Implement the ServiceCategory, Service, and ServiceRequest models.

Build the Service Category & Service Endpoints (/api/v1/services/) for listing available services.

Build the Service Request Endpoint (/api/v1/requests/) for creating a new job.

Implement the critical Provider Matching Endpoint (/api/v1/matching/available-requests/) using the bounding box + Haversine distance logic.

Implement the requests/{id}/accept/ endpoint with logic to ensure a job is only assigned once.

Frontend (React):

Customer Dashboard: Build the "Request a Service" feature, where a user can select a service from a list and submit it with their GPS location.

Customer Dashboard: Create a view to list the customer's active and past service requests with their statuses.

Provider Dashboard: Create a primary view that polls the available-requests/ endpoint and displays nearby jobs.

Provider Dashboard: Add functionality for a provider to click "Accept" on a job, which updates the UI and makes the job "theirs".

Milestone at End of Phase 2:
A customer can submit a service request. A nearby provider can see this request on their dashboard and accept it. The request's status correctly updates for both users.

Phase 3: Bringing the App to Life with Real-Time Features (Weeks 8-10)

Goal: Integrate WebSockets to implement live location tracking and in-app chat, making the application dynamic and interactive.

Key Tasks:

Backend (Django):

Integrate the Pusher SDK for Python.

Implement the ChatMessage model.

Build the Communication Endpoints (/api/v1/chat/) to post and retrieve messages. When a message is posted, broadcast it via Pusher to the recipient's channel.

Build the Real-time Tracking Endpoint (/api/v1/tracking/requests/{id}/location/). When called, it updates the provider's location in the DB and broadcasts it via Pusher.

Add WebSocket triggers for status changes (e.g., when a provider accepts a job, a notification is pushed to the customer).

Frontend (React):

Integrate the Pusher JS library.

Integrate Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap (using react-leaflet) into the active service request page.

On the customer's side, listen for WebSocket location updates and animate the provider's marker on the map.

Build a live Chat component within the service request page that sends and receives messages in real time.

Milestone at End of Phase 3:
Once a job is accepted, the customer can see the provider's location moving on a map. Both customer and provider can communicate via a fully functional in-app chat.

Phase 4: Closing the Loop - Payments & Reviews (Weeks 11-12)

Goal: Complete the full service cycle by implementing the payment and review systems.

Key Tasks:

Backend (Django):

Implement the Transaction and Review models.

Integrate the Safaricom Daraja API sandbox.

Build the Payment Endpoints (/api/v1/payments/): one to initiate the STK push, and a separate webhook to receive the callback from the Daraja server.

Build the Rating and Review Endpoints (/api/v1/reviews/).

Add a Django signal to automatically update a provider's average_rating whenever a new review is saved.

Frontend (React):

For completed jobs, display "Pay Now" and "Leave a Review" options.

Build the UI flow for the customer to confirm payment.

Create a review submission modal/form with star ratings and a comment box.

Update the provider's public profile page to display their average rating and all comments.

Milestone at End of Phase 4:
A customer can complete a job, initiate a simulated M-Pesa payment, and leave a review. The review and payment status are reflected correctly in the system.

Phase 5: Administration, Notifications & Final Polish (Weeks 13-14)

Goal: Build the admin interface for platform management, add persistent notifications, and prepare the project for demonstration.

Key Tasks:

Backend (Django):

Implement the Notification model.

Create backend logic to generate notifications for key events (e.g., job completed, new review, etc.).

Build all Admin Management Endpoints (/api/v1/admin/), focusing on provider verification. Secure these endpoints so only admin users can access them.

Build the Notification Endpoints (/api/v1/notifications/me/).

Integrate Twilio for OTP and SendGrid for welcome emails, replacing any mock/console-based services.

Frontend (React):

Create an Admin section/dashboard in the app (or a separate app) that is only accessible to admins.

Build the UI for the admin to view providers awaiting verification and approve them with a button click.

Add a notification icon/area in the main app UI to display a user's notifications.

General:

Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of all user flows.

Refine the UI/UX based on testing feedback.

Write comprehensive project documentation and a user manual.

Milestone at End of Phase 5:
The QUICKASSIST platform is feature-complete, robustly tested, and ready for your final year project demonstration. The admin can manage the platform, and all third-party services are fully integrated.

again ensure to be detailed as possible ensuring all the api endpoint that you create are working clearly and are roboust and well structured and  for now do the  backend part to be done in phase one and only after that its when we will proceed with the frontend of the phase 1. Remember you are and experienced developer and also avoid error
